## Current Issues
1. TypeScript compilation errors:
   - Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk'
   - Property 'memoryDim' issues in types.ts and model.ts
   - Object literal errors with memoryDim

2. Progress on Todo List (Phase 1):
   - Added dotenv, pino, and pino-pretty for logging ✅
   - Started fixing memoryDim type issues (partial) ⚠️
   - Implementation of memory leak prevention still incomplete ⚠️

3. Next Steps:
   - Complete type definition fixes for memoryDim
   - Fix the tensor memory leaks with tf.tidy()
   - Finalize the MCP SDK integration
   - Implement proper error handling

## Development Environment

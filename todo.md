Okay, based on the review and the goal of making this a "ready-to-use system that can be plugged in and works," here's a prioritized list of improvements:

**Phase 1: Critical Stability & Core Functionality** (Must-haves for basic reliability)

1.  **Resolve Server Strategy:**
    *   **Problem:** Having both an MCP server (`src/index.ts`) and an Express/WebSocket server (`src/server.ts`) managing separate model instances is confusing and likely redundant for a "plug-in" system.
    *   **Action:** Decide which interface is primary. If MCP (`index.ts`) is the intended interface, **remove** `src/server.ts` and its tests (`src/__tests__/server.test.ts`). If the HTTP/WS server is needed, clearly document its purpose and how it relates to the MCP server (e.g., is it an alternative interface, or does one proxy to the other?). **This is the most critical structural decision.**
2.  **Fix Deployment Configuration:**
    *   **Problem:** The `.replit` deployment command uses `npm run watch`, which is for development, not production.
    *   **Action:** Change `[deployment].run` in `.replit` to `["sh", "-c", "npm run build && npm run start"]` or similar, ensuring it builds *then* runs the production server (`node build/index.js`).
3.  **Address Memory Leaks (Critical):**
    *   **Problem:** TensorFlow.js requires careful memory management. `forward`, `trainStep` (loss function), and loops like in `train_sequence` are likely leaking tensors.
    *   **Action:** Systematically wrap the core logic of these functions/scopes with `tf.tidy()`. Meticulously review any remaining manual `dispose()` calls to ensure no intermediate tensors are missed. This is crucial for long-running server stability.
4.  **Pin Dependencies:**
    *   **Problem:** Using `"latest"` for `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` introduces instability risk.
    *   **Action:** Replace `"latest"` in `package.json` with a specific version range (e.g., `^0.1.0`). Run `npm install` to update `package-lock.json`.
5.  **Align README with Reality:**
    *   **Problem:** The README lists highly advanced features (LLM Cache, dynamic allocation, replay, etc.) and makes claims about comprehensive testing for them, which might not be fully implemented or deeply tested yet. The citation is also incorrect.
    *   **Action:** **Carefully review** `src/model.ts` and the tests. Update the README's "Features" and "Testing" sections to *accurately* reflect the *current* state of implementation and verification. Remove or mark unimplemented features clearly (e.g., "Planned" or remove entirely). Fix the arXiv citation. Implement the stubbed `store/retrieve_memory_state` functions or remove them and their descriptions.

**Phase 2: Robustness & Maintainability** (Making it reliable and easier to manage)

6.  **Refactor and Improve Testing:**
    *   **Problem:** Tests for advanced ML features are superficial (shape checks). `index.test.ts` is misnamed/redundant. MCP logic lacks dedicated tests.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Merge useful tests from `src/__tests__/index.test.ts` into `src/__tests__/model.test.ts` and delete the former, or rename it appropriately.
        *   Enhance `model.test.ts` to validate the *behavior* and *correctness* of implemented features (attention, hierarchical memory, manifold steps) beyond just shape checks.
        *   Create tests specifically for the MCP server logic in `src/index.ts` (tool dispatching, schema handling, error responses), potentially mocking the transport.
7.  **Standardize Model Persistence:**
    *   **Problem:** Using Node.js `fs` for saving/loading TF.js variables bypasses potentially more robust TF.js mechanisms and requires manual handling of `file://`.
    *   **Action:** Investigate and preferably switch to using `tf.io.fileSystem` handlers (`tf.io.fileSystem(path).save(...)`) or `model.save(handler)` / `tf.loadLayersModel(handler)` if the model structure allows. This standardizes I/O.
8.  **Refine Error Handling:**
    *   **Problem:** Error handling is basic `try/catch`.
    *   **Action:** Provide more specific error messages. Consider defining custom error classes for different failure modes (e.g., `ModelNotInitializedError`, `InvalidInputError`). Ensure errors are propagated correctly through the chosen server interface (MCP or HTTP).
9.  **Clean Up Configuration:**
    *   **Problem:** Minor unused flags or potential omissions in config files.
    *   **Action:** Update `.gitignore` to include `build/` and `test-weights*`. Remove unused `experimentalDecorators` flags from `tsconfig.json` if not needed.

**Phase 3: Polish & Usability** (Nice-to-haves for a smoother experience)

10. **Improve Code Clarity:**
    *   **Problem:** Naming inconsistencies (`outputDim` vs `memoryDim`), potentially unused code (`ITensorOps`).
    *   **Action:** Rename `outputDim` in `TitanMemoryConfig` to `memoryDim` (or similar) for consistency. Remove the `ITensorOps` interface if unused. Review variable names for clarity.
11. **Add Logging:**
    *   **Problem:** No structured logging. Debugging issues in a running server will be hard.
    *   **Action:** Integrate a simple logging library (like `pino` or `winston`). Add logs for key events: server start, model initialization, tool calls (with anonymized parameters if necessary), errors, and potentially model performance metrics.
12. **Environment Configuration:**
    *   **Problem:** Configuration like model dimensions or learning rates might be hardcoded or passed only via API.
    *   **Action:** Consider using environment variables (e.g., via `.env` files and `dotenv` package) for default model configurations, ports, etc., making it easier to configure without code changes.

Addressing Phase 1 is essential for basic functionality. Phase 2 significantly improves robustness. Phase 3 adds professional polish. Completing these phases will move the project much closer to being a truly "plug-in-and-works" system.

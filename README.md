# Titan Memory

This repository contains an implementation of the Titan Memory architecture, a hierarchical memory model for artificial neural networks.

## Features

Currently implemented:
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Hierarchical memory structure
- Memory state persistence
- Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Planned features:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Long-term memory storage
- Memory replay for enhanced learning

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Server

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

For development with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run watch
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Architecture

The Titan Memory model employs a hierarchical approach to memory management, using multiple attention heads to process and store information in a structured format. The implementation is based on TensorFlow.js and provides both a direct API and an MCP-compliant interface.
